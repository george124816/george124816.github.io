Iâ€™m a backend-focused software engineer passionate about building scalable and efficient systems. I enjoy creating my own tools to improve my development workflow ~and am starting to maintain my own infrastructure in a homelab environment~.

My current stack includes:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/): Leveraging its powerful concurrency model to build robust and fault-tolerant applications;
- [Containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)): Containerizing almost every application to ensure consistent behavior across development and production environments;
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): Designing reliable and optimized data storage solutions;
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/): Building event-driven architectures for seamless and scalable data flow.

And no less important, I use the following tools to help me build software in a high-performance way:

- Linux with [i3 environment](https://i3wm.org/);
- Neovim with [this configuration](https://github.com/george124816/nvim/).

With a strong foundation in these technologies, I strive to develop systems that are resilient, maintainable, and easy to operate.
